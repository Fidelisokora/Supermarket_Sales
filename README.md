The visualization provides a complete view of supermarket sales performance across various dimensions, including:
Product breakdown: We can analyze sales data by product line to identify top performers and areas for improvement.Customer segmentation is the study of customer purchasing behavior by type (for example, loyalty members vs. regular customers) in order to better understand their preferences and optimize marketing strategies.
Intraday trends: Sales patterns are visualized according to time of day, revealing peak hours and potential opportunities for targeted promotions.
Profitability analysis: Profitability is determined by product line, allowing us to concentrate on high-margin categories and improve inventory management.
Geographic performance: Sales performance is compared across cities, revealing regional differences and opportunities for targeted location-based marketing.
Payment method breakdown: Analyzing sales by payment method (e.g., cash, credit card, e-wallet) can help you make decisions about payment processing fees and potential customer preferences.
